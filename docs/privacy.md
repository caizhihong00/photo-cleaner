# Privacy Policy (photoCleaner)

Effective Date: **2026-01-12**  
Contact Email: **privacy@example.com**

This Privacy Policy explains how **photoCleaner** (the “App”) collects, uses, stores, and protects your information. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please stop using the App.

## 1. Information We Collect

To provide the core feature of cleaning older photos and videos in your library, the App may access the following:

- **Photo Library permission (Photos)**: to read the list of photos/videos and related metadata (e.g., creation date, media type, duration) so the App can filter by time and display results.
- **In-app interaction data**: such as the items you select/deselect and filter choices (time threshold, media type). This is used only to support the App’s UI and workflow.

By default, we do not require you to provide identity information such as your name, phone number, or government ID.

## 2. How We Use Information

- **On-device scanning and filtering**: the App analyzes items on your device locally and filters older photos/videos based on creation date.
- **On-device display and management**: the App displays results (list/grid) for preview, selection, and cleanup actions.
- **Deletion**: after you confirm, the App requests the system Photo Library to delete selected items. iOS may show system permission and/or confirmation prompts.

## 3. Sharing and Uploading

**We do not upload your photos or videos to our servers.** The App does not require accounts or login.

If we add analytics, crash reporting, cloud sync, or other services in the future, we will disclose it clearly and update this policy.

## 4. Storage and Security

- **Where data is stored**: cleanup-related data (e.g., filter settings, selection state) may be stored temporarily on your device.
- **Security**: we follow iOS permission mechanisms and do not access content you have not authorized.

## 5. Your Choices and Rights

- **Withdraw permission**: you can change or revoke Photo Library access at any time in iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Photos.
- **Deletion control**: deletions are initiated only by your actions and confirmation; you can avoid deletion by not selecting items.

## 6. Children’s Privacy

If you are a minor, please use the App with the consent and guidance of a parent or guardian.

## 7. Updates to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will be posted on this page and the “Effective Date” will be updated.
